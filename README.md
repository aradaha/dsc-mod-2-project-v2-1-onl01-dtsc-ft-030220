## Introduction

Machine Learning Using Regression Analysis. The data consists of 16.000+ house sales in King County, U.S. with c. 20 variables for each house ranging from nr of bathrooms to quality of views. Both numerical and categorical values are included. The result of the analysis is a model for predicting house prices with a chosen set of variables.

In this project I first examined the data by turning it into a dataframe. From there I could tell what needed cleaning and I did so using a couple of methods. I then examined the data using different graphing techniques. From there I used a couple of methods to eliminate outliers and created new categories that would be useful in interpreting the data.

By looking at the graphs I could tell there were many outliers in the data, so I got rid of them by singling them out and dropping.

After this, I determined how good of a predictor various categories would be, and eliminated most based on that. I started with over a hundred categories, and ended with less than 30, while retaining an r-squared of .6. The model is able to predict house prices the majority of the time based on these factors.
